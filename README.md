## Screenshots

using ipython Jupyter notebooks to interactively use program and visualize data

## Dependencies
Python3 Pacakges:
- numpy
- matplotlib


## Usage

You can use a REPL for to run the program but it is advised to use jupyter notebooks online.

> Alternatively you can install the VS code extensions "Jupyter" and "Jupyter Notebook Renderers", say yes to installing required dependencies, then using the interactive page to run the code as seen in the screenshot.

A useful library of sorting algorithms 'pysort' can be got via
